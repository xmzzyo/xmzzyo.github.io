## About Me (邢铭哲 Xing Mingzhe)

I am a last-year Ph.D. student in the Department of Computer Science at Peking University, advised by [Prof. Zhen Xiao](http://zhenxiao.com/).

Before coming to PKU, I received my Master's degree at the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences, supervised by [Prof. Qing Wang](https://people.ucas.ac.cn/~wangqing). I obtained my Bachelor's degree at Huazhong University of Science and Technology.



## Research

My research interests focus on **AI for System & Software Engineering**, an interdisciplinary field integrating machine learning, software engineering, and cloud systems. I am committed to investigating and addressing efficiency, effectiveness, and reliability challenges within systems and software engineering domains with machine learning algorithms.
